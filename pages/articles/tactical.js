                The methods described here may deviate from others with whom
                espouse the European competition methods, but with all things,
                there are not right or wrong ways of fishing, just methods that
                work better than others in each situation. In this article, I
                describe the methods that I employ most often.

              Each season’s championship fly fishing strategies remained
              vigorously guarded until a better approach was discovered. When
              that happened, previously winning tactics became irrelevant and
              were essentially leaked to the press. It took many years for word
              of the winning strategies to reach American shores. A steady
              trickle of anglers adopting the European angling techniques were
              quietly gathering in fly fishing Internet Relay Chat (IRC) rooms
              to share ideas. It was not until team USA brought home the gold
              that the word on the streets about Euro-Nymphing went viral.
            </p>

              While I had no interest, or resources for that matter, to compete
              back in the 1990’s, I was no stranger to what was happening in the
              fly fishing scene overseas. I started putting into practice the
              techniques I had accumulated via letters, internet dialog, and
              primarily, imported fly fishing periodicals from the era.
            </p>
            <p>
              I spent a lot of time fishing the Deschutes River as part of a
              healing journey in my twenties. I had a campsite next to a
              favorite pool where I often slept under the stars. It was a very
              reliable location that I could fish as if it were a pool table,
              calling out corner pockets and making presentations in my mind. I
              found a certain flat shaped rock positioned in the heart of the
              pool, and I discovered that standing on it allowed me to cover the
              sweet spot in which fish competed for first dibs on anything
              drifting to them. Back then, the extra foot of height I gained
              over the water by standing on that rock was like fishing with the
              advantage of an extra foot of rod length. While I yearned for a
              10’ 3-weight rod back then, I used a 10’ 5-weight to be able to
              handle the steelhead I would often catch while Czech nymphing.

            <p>
              I arrived to my favorite pool to find my usual bank-side campsite
              was occupied. I asked permission of the campsite occupant if I
              might step into the river and fish the pool. I was greeted with a
              kind welcome and allowed to proceed. I had an audience as I wade
              out, looking back occasionally to calibrate my location via the
              pink tape markers that I hid in the bank-side alders a few seasons
              prior. If I lined up the two tags with the third reference point,
              I could triangulate my rock right away and not disturb the pool
              with my clumsy wading around while looking for it.
            </p>
            <p>"Excuse me."</p>
            <p>
              I thought I heard something but ignored it, as I often hear a
              phenomenon of human voices embedded within the sound in this
              riffle. Ignoring it, I continued to make presentations.
            </p>
            <p>"Excuse me, may I ask what you are doing?"</p>
            <p>I wasn’t losing my mind; I did hear voices.</p>
            <p>"Sure," pausing to face my host.</p>
            <p>
              He said, “I've been camping here, fishing where you are standing
              all weekend, and I've only caught two fish. You've been here a
              half-hour, and you’ve landed 5. What the heck are you doing?"
            </p>
            <p>
              At that time I realized I was doing something different. I had
              gone from the high stick and drop-shot method to Czech nymphing
              with a heavily weighted fly.
            </p>
            <p>
              I explained to him that I was a Czech nymphing with a heavy fly
              and no split shot. Each time I cast upstream, I would control the
              line by applying a very slight downstream drag while keeping the
              line taught and out of the water. I caught more fish because I was
              eliminating vertical drag and slack, two limiting factors for
              nymphing success. Fish will inspect our flies as they would most
              anything looking edible drifting towards them by taking the fly
              into their mouths for an inspection. Vertical drag and slack in
              our presentations limit our ability to detect the take when this
              happens. The fish reject our flies and swim away long before
              realize it, if at all. You may have had hundreds of opportunities
              to fight a fish, but they all rejected your fly without tripping
              any alerts you may have been employing. By keeping the line
              taught, the fish inevitably trips the alarm, and we can react fast
              enough to affect a solid hookup.
            </p>
            <p>
              That was that. A simple modification in tactics can dramatically
              change our success. I hope that guy owned the pool after I left.

            <h2>Hitting Your Target</h2>

            <p>
              To efficiently fish the European methods of nymphing, you must get
              the nymph to sink to the depth that fish are holding. Achieving
              the proper depth is a matter of selecting the right weight or
              combination of weighted patterns. Attaching lead or tin sinkers to
              the leader alters the sensitivity of your rig interfering with the
              feel of the take. Subsequently, a well-stocked fly box must
              contain a full gamut of sizes and weights of tungsten beaded
              nymphs that will aid in your tactical approach to nymphing all
              water types.

            <p>
              As rule of thumb to ensure that my guests are fishing at the
              correct depth, the nymph should tap bottom at least once every
              third or fourth presentation. If they (you) are never bouncing
              bottom, I switch to a heavier nymph or lengthen the tippet section
              below the sighter. I find five feet of level tippet under the
              sighter an optimal length. I rarely increase that tippet length
              and most likely will just switch to heavier or lighter pattern to
              make the necessary adjustments. If I am touching bottom repeatedly
              during each drift, I will use a lighter nymph, or combination of
              weighted flies. Fishing too heavy may require additional manual
              adjustments to control the depth by raising the rod and line
              higher into the air.
            </p>

            <h2>Keeping Things in Sight</h2>
            <p>
              When using a French leader in a long-range situation, a sighter
              maintained above the water surface should give you visual feedback
              to the approximate location of the nymph and indicate if you are
              in proper control of the drift. Optimally, the sighter should be
              kept in a downstream position relative to the fly, pointing
              slightly upstream during the first half of the presentation. As
              the fly drifts by you, begin lifting as much of the line and
              leader off the water as necessary to maintain direct contact with
              the nymph, at this point the sighter should be mostly in a
              vertical position just above or in part within the water surface.
            </p>

                    allowing for long range, delicate presentations.

                </div>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>
              As the fly progresses downstream of your position, the sighter
              should act like the hands of a clock rotating around while still
              pointing at the fly. When the fly passes into the downstream
              portion of the drift, a tight line is crucial for detecting the
              take. If the sighter lingers in the current too long, remains
              stationary, or if too much drag occurs allowing the fly to drift
              downstream of the sighter itself, you will lose contact and not
              detect most takes. Correcting drag during a tight line
              presentation usually involves keeping the rod tip held downstream
              of the sighter and sometimes even pulling downstream to tighten up
              any slack that may occur.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many configurations and "correct" versions of European
              nymphing leaders with many purists on the interwebs claiming to
              have the only true European method and thus, defend their choices
              as the high priests of a fugitive religion. The simple fact is
              that not every leader rig will work for every situation. I have
              spent the better part of twenty years modifying and tweaking
              "Czech" leaders to suit my needs and trying every leader I can. I
              have built and used countless leaders from hand tied mono leaders
              to furled leaders to merely using long lengths of level
              monofilament. The leader rig I describe on this page has risen to
              the top of the heap to become my base leader of choice that I use
              on many rivers that I fish.
            </p>

            <p>
              I am not a purist in any sense of the word nor am I following Fips
              Mouche sanctioned events and rules. I simply want to have as many
              options as possible to choose from when I am out fishing. Fishing
              large western rivers such as the Colorado, Deschutes, Madison or
              Roaring Fork Rivers require a different set up than a traditional
              Czech or Polish rig can handle. I have found on these large
              western rivers, the French leader system to be the best option for
              fishing a tight line while still keeping direct contact with my
              flies at distances not easily obtained with Czech style leaders.
              When fishing smaller rivers, switching to a traditional Czech
              leader is a good option. There are no right or wrongs, simple
              methods that work better than others in any given situation; this
              is what tactical fly fishing is all about; adaptability. 
            </p>
            <p>
              A leader I like is hand made with a formula taken from Jonathan
              White's book French Nymphing the New Way. I like the "Slow Action
              Long-Range Indicator Leader" described on page 17 because I can
              make accurate long-range distance casts with it. I make a
              bicolored sighter that is greased with floatant for long range
              drifts where the base leader and sighter will float on the surface
              of the water.
            </p>

            <p>
              Allowing portions of the base leader to float is a feature of the
              French leader. Employing a tight (straight) line on the leader
              allows the angler to remain in contact with the fly while the
              sighter is incredibly sensitive providing amazing visual feedback.
              A sighter is an essential tool in this set up acting much like a
              bobber indicator where you may lose the feel of the take but still
              keep in visual contact. The sighter also indicates the location
              and depth of your fly so making manual adjustments to the drift
              almost becomes innate. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Keep in mind that while fishing a French leader, you are still
              keeping a tight line on your presentation except that in long
              range situations, you have the leader and possibly fly line
              floating on the surface of the water. The line that remains on the
              water surface taxes a handicap on the tactile feel of the take.
              This handicap is overcome by a greased bi-colored sighter so that
              a fish taking our nymph is seen just as often as it is felt. This
              opens up a broader swath of water that you can efficiently cover
              while employing a tightline technique.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
              For several season, I have been using pre-made competition laders
              from Hanak and Hends. I find I can cast them as I would a fly line
              while using my 3wt nymph rods. Another benefit to the pre-made
              leaders is the smooth movement through the guides as you strip in
              the slack.
            </p>
            <p>
              Commercially prepared leaders solve many problems I dislike with
              knotted leaders. Increased drag where the knots interact with the
              water and knots that snag in the guides.
